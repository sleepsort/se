#!/usr/bin/env vim

Bug 00:
  support external config file

Bug 01:
  use keyboard distance to weight edit distance

#Bug 02:
#  support b-tree

Bug 03:
  use only one kind of file library (stdio or iostream)!
  sizeof(streampos) != sizeof(long long), which is unnecessarily 
  dangerous

Bug 04:
  when Btree occupies 2G data, fread will fail!
